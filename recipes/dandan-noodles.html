    <p>It serves two people, either in one big bowl to share, or in two separate bowls. If you wish, you can blanch a handful of leafy greens in the noodle cooking water and add to the bowl, as shown in the photograph. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <li>4 oz (100g) ground pork</li>
        <li>2 tsp Shaoxing wine</li>
        <li>1 tsp sweet fermented sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp light soy sauce</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>7 oz (200g) dried Chinese wheat flour noodles, or 11 oz (300g) fresh noodles</li>

        <p>For the marinade:</p>
        <li>1 tsp Shaoxing wine</li>
        <li>1½ tsp potato flour</li>
        <p>For the sauce:</p>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>¾ tsp potato flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Chinkiang vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chicken stock or water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the chicken as evenly as possible into ½ in (1½cm) strips, then cut these into small cubes. Place in a small bowl. Add the marinade ingredients together with 1 tbsp water, mix well and set aside while you prepare the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Peel and thinly slice the garlic and ginger and chop the spring onions into chunks as long as their diameter (to match the chicken cubes). Snip the chillies in half or into sections. Discard their seeds as far as possible. Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat a seasoned wok over a high flame. Add the oil with the chillies and Sichuan pepper and stir-fry briefly until the chillies are darkening but not burned (remove the wok from the heat if necessary to prevent overheating).</li>
        <li>Quickly add the chicken and stir-fry over a high flame, stirring constantly. As soon as the chicken cubes have separated, add the ginger, garlic and spring onions and continue to stir-fry until they are fragrant and the meat just cooked through (test one of the larger pieces to make sure).</li>
        <li>Give the sauce a stir and add it to the wok, continuing to stir and toss. As soon as the sauce has become thick and shiny, add the peanuts, stir them in and serve.</li>
    </ol>
